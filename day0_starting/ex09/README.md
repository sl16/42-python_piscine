# Useless Package

This is a simple example package. It's utterly useless.

## Building the package

- Install `build` if you donâ€™t already have it:
  ```pip install build```

- Build the package: 
  ```python -m build```.
  This will create a `dist/` directory containing the `.tar.gz`
  and `.whl` files for the package.

## Installation

```pip install ft_package_vbartos42```
